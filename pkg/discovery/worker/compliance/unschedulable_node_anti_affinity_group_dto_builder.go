// In Turbo, Schedulable nodes are marked with an access commodity 'schedulable'. Pods are required to buy
// this commodity so they can be moved to schedulable nodes
// Unchedulable nodes do not sell this commodity, hence pods will not be moved to these nodes.
// We want to address the issue that pods that are already running on the unschedulable nodes are not moved out
// due to compliance issues. This is done by not requiring the pods already on the unschedulable nodes at the time
// of discovery to buy the 'schedulable' commodity. Without the schedulable commodity the pod continues to stay
// on the current node unless there are resource constraints or unless moved by the kubernetes controller.
// In addition, we need pods which do not buy the schedulable commodity to not move to other unschedulable nodes.
// This is achieved by creating an anti-affinity policy for these pods against other unschedulable nodes.
